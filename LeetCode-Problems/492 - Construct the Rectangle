For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area

your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]

Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

public:
    vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
        int tar = sqrt(area);
        if(tar * tar == area)
            return vector<int>(2,tar);
        if(tar *tar < area)
            tar++;
        int l = tar,w;
        while(true){
            if(area % tar!=0)
                ++tar;
            else
                break;
        }
            
        vector<int> vct;
        vct.push_back(tar);
        vct.push_back(area/tar);
        return vct;
    }
};

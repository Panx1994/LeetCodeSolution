Descption :

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores

 who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

Example 1:
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
Note:
1.N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
2.All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

public:
    vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> sorted(nums);
        sort(sorted.begin(),sorted.end(),greater<int>());
        int size = nums.size();
        vector<string> vct(size,"");
        //对于nums内的每一个ele，寻找其在sorted里面的位置
        for(int i = 0;i<size;++i)
        {
            int cur = nums[i];
            string ans;
            for(int j = 0; j < size;++j)
            {
                //一个必然能找到的位置
                if(sorted[j] == cur)
                {
                    if(j == 0)
                        ans = "Gold Medal";
                    else if(j == 1)
                        ans = "Silver Medal";
                    else if(j == 2)
                        ans = "Bronze Medal";
                    else if(j > 2)
                        ans = to_string(j + 1);
                    break;
                }   
            }
            vct[i] = ans;
        }
        return vct;
    }
};
